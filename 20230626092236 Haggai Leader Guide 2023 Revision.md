<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to leading this ten-week class in the book of Haggai! I pray God would speak to you in His Word and help you teach your students. As you go through the study, you should work from the Student Guide as well. Then, at the end of the week, use the leader guide to prepare to teach. Each lesson in the Leader Guide includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Answers to the student guide questions.</li>
<li>A lesson plan for teaching.</li>
<li>The goal of this class is to teach both the meaning of the book of Haggai and to sharpen Bible reading skills. Therefore, each class has both a content goal (what students should learn from Haggai) and a skills goal (how students should grow in Bible reading).</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these two goals, each lesson includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A song to open class with based on the content of the lesson.</li>
<li>An introduction to get students talking about the material.</li>
<li>A “See Discussion” to guide students in a conversation about the meaning of the text.</li>
<li>A teaching opportunity for a brief monologue about the skill emphasized that week.</li>
<li>A “Savor, Shift, Share” discussion to guide students in a conversation about how the theology they’ve seen hits their hearts and lives.</li>
<li>What students should know before next class.</li>
</ul>
<p>May Haggai speak as loudly and clearly today as he did when He was alive!</p>

<p>•     <strong>Read the summary of Israel’s history below, looking up the Bible references as you do. Where do you see the themes of exile and God’s house/temple?</strong> Check appendix one for highlights.</p>
<p>•     <strong>Now read Ezra 1–6. Extend the summary from above to include Ezra 1–6. How do you see the themes of exile and God’s house/temple continue?</strong> God fulfills his promise to Jeremiah (Jer 25:12) by bringing his people back to the land to rebuild the temple (1:2). Cyrus provides goods to build the temple with (1:4–11). So many Israelites return to inhabit the land and rebuild the temple. They rebuild the temple furnishings (3:1–8) and lay the foundation of the temple (1:11). They are opposed by the enemies of God (4), but under the leadership of Zerubabel (3:2) and with the help of Darius (6:1) the temple is finished and dedicated to God (6:13–18).</p>

</table><p>•     <strong>Where are God’s people at the start of the book of Ezra? Where are they at the start of the book of Haggai?</strong> They are in Persia and going back to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>•     <strong>Why did God bring his people back from Persia in Ezra 1?</strong> 1) to keep His word. 2) To rebuild His temple.</p>
<h3 id="lesson-plan">Lesson Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Lesson Goals:</strong> - <strong>Content:</strong> Confirm student understanding of the basic historical background of the book of Haggai. - <strong>Skills:</strong> Give students confidence and tools to get background information from Bible. - Set expectations for homework completion and class discussion.</p>
<h4 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h4>
<p><em>Open by singing “How Firm a Foundation.”</em></p>
<p>•     Expectations for class.</p>
<p>–     Class structure.</p>
<p>•     Class Format</p>
<p>•     Lesson goals</p>
<p>–     Homework expectations.</p>
<p>•     Report on experience with homework.</p>
<h4 id="“see”-discussion">“See” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     <strong>“You read Haggai once at the beginning of the homework, and then again at the end after you worked on the background. What did you see that you didn’t see before?”</strong> Help students see the importance of understanding historical background.</p>
<p>•     “<strong>Tell me about what you learned as you thought about the story of the Bible from Genesis until Ezra 6 in terms of exile and God’s house.”</strong> For many students, this is the first time they are trying to trace a theme across books in the Bible. Help them understand the concept.</p>
<p>•     <strong>“How does the timeline help you understand Haggai?”</strong></p>
<p>•     <strong>“Where else did you find the characters in Haggai in the Bible? What stuck out to you as important?”</strong></p>
<p>•     <strong>“What was the purpose(s) of God bringing his people back to Jerusalem?”</strong> 1) Keep His word. 2) Rebuild God’s house.</p>
<h4 id="teaching">Teaching</h4>
<p><strong>Main Point:</strong> Researching historical background information isn’t beyond your skills.</p>
<p>You used three skills to find background information in this lesson: 1. Reading Haggai. Without reading the book you don’t know what you are looking for. 2. Search the rest of the Bible for dates and names. 3. Use resources like an OT survey and study Bible.</p>
<h4 id="“savor-shift-share”-discussion">“Savor, Shift, Share” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     “Did God use Haggai to speak to any of you in a special way this week?”</p>
<p>•     “What are you hoping to learn in this study? How you are you hoping for God to change you?”</p>
<p><strong>For next class:</strong> - Print Haggai double-spaced with extra wide margins so that students can draw connections between repeated themes. - Use the Lesson 2 Leader’s guide to make sure students understand how to make observations and get familiar with the text.</p>
<p><em>Close class by praying for God to work in our lives.</em></p>
<h2 id="lesson-2-getting-familiar">Lesson 2: Getting Familiar</h2>
<h3 id="study-guide-answers-1">Study Guide Answers</h3>
<p>There are no right or wrong answers to this week’s questions. Make sure students have what they need to listen to and read Haggai in many different versions.</p>
<p>It is important is that you make sure they know what they are doing with the printed text as they mark it up.</p>
<p>Students will write a one-sentence summary of each paragraph. This will force them to really understand what Haggai says. Encourage them that while this might be hard, this will go the furthest in their understanding.</p>
<h3 id="lesson-plan-1">Lesson Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Lesson Goals:</strong> - <strong>Content:</strong> Get a good handle on the content of Haggai. - <strong>Skills:</strong> Repeated reading and inductive study.</p>
<h4 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h4>
<p><em>Open by singing “Praise to the Lord, the Almighty.”</em></p>
<p>•     Ask students what their experience reading repeatedly and studying inductively was like.</p>
<h4 id="“see”-discussion-1">“See” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     Put students in small groups to share important observations and sentence summaries.</p>
<h4 id="teaching-1">Teaching</h4>
<p><strong>Main point:</strong> Read the whole book over and over so that you get a sense for the whole thing.</p>
<h4 id="“savor-shift-share”-discussion-1">“Savor, Shift, Share” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     Ask students what verses stuck out to them and what their journal entries were about.</p>
<p>•     Ask students what applications God gave them to live out from Haggai.</p>
<p>•     Ask students about their experience sharing a verse from Haggai with someone in their family.</p>
<p><strong>For next class:</strong> - Make sure that students understand how to make the outline for lesson three.</p>
<p><em>Close class by praying for God to work in our lives.</em></p>
<h2 id="lesson-3-outline">Lesson 3: Outline</h2>
<h3 id="study-guide-answers-2">Study Guide Answers</h3>
<p>Students are using their familiarity with Haggai to break it into sections and distill it to an outline.</p>
<p>Here is an example of what that outline might be like:</p>

</table><h4 id="introduction-3">Introduction</h4>
<p><em>Open by singing “Great is Thy Faithfulness”</em></p>
<p>•     Ask students how hard it was to make outline.</p>
<p>–     First focus on how they found literary units.</p>
<p>–     Second focus on how they summarized them and what it was like.</p>
<h4 id="“see”-discussion-2">“See” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     Put students in small groups to compare and contrast outlines.</p>
<p>–     Tell them they are welcome to change their own based on what others in their group help them see.</p>
<h4 id="teaching-2">Teaching</h4>
<p><strong>Main Point:</strong> Identify literary units by looking for repeated phrases or clear shifts. Summarize units by repeated reading and understanding.</p>
<h4 id="“savor-shift-share”-discussion-2">“Savor, Shift, Share” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     Share one of the principles from your outline. Ask the class if anyone had something similar. If so, ask them to share their application.</p>
<p>•     Continue like this as long as time permits.</p>
<p><strong>For next class:</strong> - This week students will study Haggai 1:1–11. - Make sure students understand how to make a spiritual journal entry. - Encourage students to actually do the Shift and Share exercises.</p>

<h3 id="study-guide-answers-3">Study Guide Answers</h3>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>Read Ezra 1:2–4. Why did the Israelites come back to the land?</strong> In order to rebuild God’s temple.</p>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>Read Jer 51:15–24 looking for the title “LORD of hosts.” Is it encouraging for Israel or discouraging in that passage? How about in Haggai 1:2?</strong> In Jer 51:15–24 it is encouraging for Israel to have the Lord of Heaven’s Armies on their side. Now the Lord of Heaven’s Armies chastises them.</p>
<p>–     ☐ <strong>How many times is the title “LORD of hosts” used in the book of Haggai?</strong> 12. 1:2, 5, 7, 9, 14; 2:4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 23</p>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>1:1–5 Why is God upset about the temple not being rebuilt? List as many answers as you can think of.</strong> The answer at the core of the issue is that it demonstrates that God’s people don’t care much about God.</p>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>1:4</strong> <strong>What does “paneled” add to v. 4?</strong> It shows that God’s people have made their houses even better than they need to be.</p>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>1:6, 10–11</strong> <strong>How did God try to get his people’s attention before speaking through Haggai?</strong>. God cursed his people with plagues.</p>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>1:8</strong> <strong>Why does God say he wants the temple to be built? What’s that mean?</strong> God wants the temple rebuilt so that he will be glorified. Glorified means God will be honored, celebrated, shown excellent.</p>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>1:8</strong> <strong>Why does it bring God *dis*pleasure and *dis*honor for the temple to lie in *dis*repair?</strong> God must take pleasure in his own honor. Therefore, when God’s people dishonor God by leaving the temple in disrepair it brings God displeasure.</p>

<p>•     ☐ <strong>1:12</strong> <strong>What did God’s people do in response to Haggai’s message? (Hint: two things). What do they mean?</strong> They obeyed God and feared Him. This means that they did what he said, namely build the temple and their hearts reverenced Him.</p>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>1:14</strong> <strong>What caused the people to work on the temple?</strong> God stirring in their hearts.</p>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>1:15</strong> <strong>How long did it take the people to begin work on the temple after Haggai delivered his message? Do you think that’s fast or slow? What does Haggai want you to think by including it in the book?</strong></p>

<h3 id="study-guide-answers-5">Study Guide Answers</h3>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>What reason does 2:4 give for the people to be strong and continue working?</strong> The presence of God.</p>
<p>–     ☐ <strong>What other reasons might they have been working for?</strong> To rebuild their nation, to stay safe from enemies, because their respected leaders told them to.</p>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>What does 2:5 add to 2:4?</strong> God’s presence with his people is according to his covenant love forged at the Exodus.</p>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>God promises to be with his people in 2:4. He promises that His Spirit is with them in 2:5. When does this most ultimately happen (cf. Matt 1:23, Rom 8:9–10, 1 Cor 3:16)?</strong> When Jesus comes to earth God dwells with his people. When Jesus leaves He gives his people the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>–     ☐ <strong>How does this change the way that *you* hear 2:4–5?</strong> This means that I have even more reason than Israel to “be strong” because God dwells within me always.</p>
<p>•     ☐ <strong>In your own words, what does God promise to do in 2:6–9?</strong> God will judge the nations, take their wealth, and improve the temple they are building so that it is even greater than Solomon’s temple.</p>
<p>–     ☐ <strong>What will God’s people do to make these things take place?</strong> Nothing at all.</p>
<p>–     ☐ <strong>Has this happened? If not, when will it happen?</strong> It will be fulfilled after the Day of the Lord on the New Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Main Point:</strong> Scripture never contradicts itself, so we can fit passages like Haggai 2:6–9 in the context of the rest of the Bible to understand better.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-7---210–19">Lesson 7 - 2:10–19</h2>
<h3 id="study-guide-answers-6">Study Guide Answers</h3>
<p>•     <strong>2:12–13</strong> <strong>What are the rules for how cleanliness and uncleanliness travels?</strong> Clean items do not make things that they touch clean. But unclean items <em>do</em> make what they touch unclean.</p>
<p>•     <strong>This passage introduces a *second* problem for God’s people. The first problem was that they neglected to build God’s house (1:2). What does 2:14 say the other problem is?</strong> The temple that the people are building is unclean because the same principle that applies to ceremonial uncleanness applies to real moral guilt.</p>
<p>•     <strong>2:14</strong> <strong>“…what they offer there is unclean…” Why is that such a big problem?</strong> The sacrificial system is supposed to be Israel’s method of becoming clean before God. But if their sacrifices are unclean they will not be effectual.</p>
<p>•     <strong>2:16–18</strong> <strong>Why has God been punishing Israel?</strong> God used disasters to try to get the attention of the people.</p>
<p>•     <strong>2:15–19</strong> <strong>After what does God begin to bless Israel?</strong> After they honor him by beginning to rebuild the temple.</p>
<p>•     <strong>Combine the problem of 2:14 and God’s response in 2:19 to form a principle. List five reasons to delight that it is true.</strong> When 2:14 is combined with 2:19 you see that God’s blessing is <em>completely</em> from grace. The sacrifices don’t prompt God’s blessing, God gives it even though “what they offer there is unclean.”</p>
<p>•     <strong>Read Heb. 10:19–23. What difference does it suggest between believers in the NT and the OT? What does it suggest is the same about God in the OT and NT?</strong> NT believers have assurance that a sacrifice great enough to truly put away their guilt has been made. OT believers were hoping in God to bring that sacrifice.</p>

<p><em>Open by singing “Before the Throne of God Above.”</em></p>
<p>•     Ask students about how their understanding of this text deepened after getting more context from The Bible Project and Lev. 21–22.</p>
<p>•     Ask students how their study went using Hebrews to shed light on Haggai.</p>
<h4 id="“see”-discussion-6">“See” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     Make sure students see the principle of cleanness not transferring but uncleanness transferring.</p>
<p>•     Then make sure they understand that God’s promised blessing is <em>all</em> of grace.</p>
<p>•     From here, transition to Heb. 10:19–23 and ask for students answers about the difference between the OT and the NT.</p>
<h4 id="teaching-6">Teaching</h4>
<p><strong>Main Point:</strong> You can use Scripture to interpret, appropriate, and apply Scripture.</p>
<p>The student guide for this section used Lev. 21:1–22:16 to interpret what Haggai 2:10–19 means. Then it used Heb. 10:19–23 to appropriate the truth to a NT context. Finally, it used Heb. 10:26–31 to apply that truth to present life. Encourage students to use scripture to interpret, appropriate, and apply the Bible’s truth to their life.</p>
<h4 id="“savor-shift-share”-discussion-6">“Savor, Shift, Share” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     The main truth of Heb. 10:19–23 is that Christ’s sacrifice is totally sure. Encourage students to glory in the fact of their full forgiveness. Help them see that God now has <em>no</em> wrath for them because of the sacrifice of Jesus.</p>
<p>•     Then move to the application from Heb. 10:26–31. This application is surprising for most who look immediately for comfort. Instead, it uses the powerful sacrifice of Christ as motivation to cease from sin that is greater even than in the OT era.</p>
<p><strong>For next class:</strong> - Make sure students are at least familiar with the idea of a person (like Zerubabbel) representing more than himself (like the Davidic king).</p>

<h2 id="lesson-8-220–23">Lesson 8: 2:20–23</h2>
<h3 id="study-guide-answers-7">Study Guide Answers</h3>
<p>•     <strong>2:21</strong> <strong>Where else in Haggai have you seen the phrase “shake the heavens and the earth”? How does that help you understand *when* God is talking about performing this judgement?</strong> In 2:6–9 God promises that the “latter glory of the temple will be greater than the former.” This temple improvement will come after God takes the wealth of the nations for His own kingdom and people. There is a clear historical time when this happened. Probably this is talking abut the future “Day of the Lord” mentioned in other prophets.</p>
<p>•     <strong>2:22</strong> <strong>Read Dan 2:44, Zech 12:9, Matt 24:7, and Zech 14:13 in context. How do these verses shape your understanding of what event God is talking about in Hag. 2:22?</strong> These passages reinforce that Haggai is probably talking about the future “Day of the Lord.”</p>
<p>•     <strong>2:23</strong> <strong>Read Jer. 22:24–26 knowing that “Conia” is short for “Jechoniah.” He is Zerubabel’s grandfather. How does this impact the importance of God putting Zerubabel on as a signant ring?</strong> Now you see that God is restoring the line of Zerubabel graciously even though he cast off his father.</p>
<p>•     <strong>A signant ring is a symbol of kingly rule. How does God expect Zerubabel to function? What does that mean?</strong> God expects his leader to be a representative of his own rule. Zerubabel isn’t the king, is ruling by the authority of the king.</p>
<p>•     <strong>Matt. 1:12–13 is the next time Zerubabel shows up in the Bible. What does this tell you about how this promise is fulfilled?</strong> As a member of the lineage of David, Zerubabel is a type of the Davidic king who will rule with perfect justice.</p>

</table><h4 id="introduction-8">Introduction</h4>
<p><em>Open by singing “Jesus Shall Reign”</em></p>
<p>•     Encourage students not to fall into the weeds of different theories of eschatology and the “Day of the Lord.” Don’t act as though they don’t matter, but encourage students to first feel what the Haggai wants them to feel.</p>
<p>•     Encourage students in their reading of Scripture. They were prepared to interpret Scripture with Scripture (2:21 with 2:6–9) and apply helpful background information (Zerubabel’s family lineage) to interpret the meaning of this short passage.</p>
<h4 id="“see”-discussion-7">“See” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     Ask questions to help students summarize their findings about the “Day of the Lord.”</p>
<p>•     Ask students how the background information about Zerbubabel changed their reading of the passage.</p>
<p>•     Ask students what it means for Zerubabel to reign as a “signant ring.”</p>
<h4 id="teaching-7">Teaching</h4>
<p><strong>Main Point:</strong> Scripture uses “types” or “shadows” to prefigure the work of God in redemption history.</p>
<p>•     Increases our confidence that God is the author of human history.</p>
<p>•     Helps appreciate the anticipation of Christ.</p>
<p>•     Demonstrates that Christ is climax of all of God’s promises.</p>
<h4 id="“savor-shift-share”-discussion-7">“Savor, Shift, Share” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     Apply ruling as a “signant ring” to the Adamic charge to take dominion over the earth as an image of God. Help students see they have a similar, although less specific, promise from God and their redemption is just as amazing. Zerubabel’s ancestor was cast off like Adam was cast off, but we are graciously restored as God’s representative rules like Zerubabel was.</p>
<p>•     Ask students for stories where God manifested his gracious attributes toward them like He did toward Zerubabel.</p>
<p><strong>For next class:</strong> - Next class will be about seeing and savoring the whole book of Haggai. Then we will shift and share based on the whole book of Haggai.</p>
<p><em>Close class by praying for God to work in our lives.</em></p>

<h3 id="study-guide-answers-8">Study Guide Answers</h3>
<p>The questions for this week are subjective or based on personal observations.</p>
<p>One way to state the main point of Haggai is that God’s presence is essential for God’s people who live by God’s grace based on future sacrifice leading to God’s righteous rule. - “God’s presence is essential for God’s people.” This is the problem at the start of the book—God’s people have left God’s temple in ruins. They believe his presence is optional, but they are dead wrong. - “God’s people live by God’s grace.” The Israelites build the temple with the help of the presence of God (1:14, 2:4–5). God is also gracious to provide for them after they begin construction even though their sacrifices are truly unclean (2:14). - “God’s grace is based on future sacrifice.” The present sacrifices are “unclean” and won’t offer forgiveness, but God is extending his blessing anyway (2:19). Since God is just, it must be based on a perfectly clean sacrifice coming in the future. - “History is headed for God’s righteous rule.” Zerubabel is an type of God’s righteous rule coming through the Davidic king. This is the final promise of the book, and the note of hope that ring sin our ears.</p>

</table><h4 id="introduction-9">Introduction</h4>
<p><em>Open by singing “I Will Glory in My Redeemer.”</em></p>
<p>•     Ask students how hard it was to hold the whole book in their head and analyze the whole thing.</p>
<h4 id="“see”-discussion-8">“See” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     Ask students what they believe the main point of Haggai is.</p>
<p>•     Put students in small groups to share their revised outlines.</p>
<h4 id="teaching-8">Teaching</h4>
<p><strong>Main Point:</strong> If we don’t put the whole book together, it’s like we watched a TV show without connecting the episodes—we’ll miss the whole big point!</p>
<h4 id="“savor-shift-share”-discussion-8">“Savor, Shift, Share” Discussion</h4>
<p>•     Remind students that every blessing for God’s people was bought at the cross of Christ. Then ask them for their list of types or pointers to Christ throughout Haggai.</p>
<p>•     Put students in small groups to share their list of God’s attributes and a time they saw it in their own lives.</p>
<p><strong>For next class:</strong> - We will be shifting and sharing based on the whole book of Haggai and the main point we’ve discovered. We’ll also be reviewing and assessing God’s work in our lives across the last several weeks. - Students may be helped by some coaching on making specific application to their own lives.</p>
